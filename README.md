# JobBoard

Project Overview
This Job Board application enables users to search and filter job listings based on location, salary, job type, and keywords. It is designed for seamless user experience with fast data rendering, an 'Apply Now' feature, and advanced client-side filtering. API caching is implemented to enhance performance and reduce redundant network requests.

- "Apply" button for each job listing (links to external application or modal).
- API caching using local storage or in-memory cache to optimize performance.
Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React.js for dynamic UI and state management
- REST API (e.g., mock JSON server or real jobs API like RapidAPI or Adzuna)
- Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling
- Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests
Learning Outcomes
- Learn how to implement advanced filtering mechanisms in frontend applications.
- Understand and apply API data caching strategies to improve speed and reduce network load.
- Enhance skills in building modular, reusable React components.
- Practice managing application state and implementing conditional rendering.
